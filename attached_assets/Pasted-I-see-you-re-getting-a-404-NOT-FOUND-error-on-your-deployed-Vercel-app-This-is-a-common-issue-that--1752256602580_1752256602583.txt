I see you're getting a 404 NOT_FOUND error on your deployed Vercel app. This is a common issue that indicates your application isn't properly configured or the routes aren't set up correctly. Here's how to fix it:

## Immediate Fixes to Try

### 1. **Check Your Project Structure**
The 404 error suggests Vercel can't find your main application file. Make sure you have one of these setups:

**For Next.js:**
```
your-project/
├── package.json
├── pages/
│   └── index.js (or index.tsx)
└── components/
```

**For React SPA:**
```
your-project/
├── package.json
├── public/
│   └── index.html
└── src/
    └── index.js
```

### 2. **Add a Landing Page**
Create a simple `pages/index.js` file (for Next.js) or ensure your main component is properly exported:

```javascript
// pages/index.js (Next.js)
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to Neon AI Modules</h1>
      <p>Your app is working!</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 3. **Check Your package.json**
Ensure your `package.json` has the correct scripts and dependencies:

```json
{
  "name": "neon-ai-modules",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "next": "^13.0.0",
    "react": "^18.0.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.0.0"
  }
}
```

### 4. **Fix Vercel Configuration**
Go to your Vercel dashboard and check:

1. **Framework Preset**: Should be "Next.js" or "Create React App"
2. **Root Directory**: Should be blank unless your app is in a subfolder
3. **Build Command**: Should be `npm run build`
4. **Output Directory**: Leave blank for Next.js

### 5. **Add vercel.json (if needed)**
If you're building a single-page application, create a `vercel.json` file:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/" }
  ]
}
```

## Step-by-Step Solution

### Step 1: Check Your Repository
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Verify you have a proper entry point file
3. Check if `package.json` exists in the root

### Step 2: Redeploy with Correct Settings
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Go to Settings → General
4. Check "Framework Preset" - change it if needed
5. Go to Deployments → Click "..." → Redeploy

### Step 3: Test Locally First
Before deploying, test locally:
```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```

### Step 4: Check Build Logs
1. In Vercel, go to your project
2. Click on the failed deployment
3. Check the "Build Logs" tab for specific errors

## Common Causes and Solutions

**Cause 1: Missing index file**
- **Solution**: Create `pages/index.js` or `src/App.js`

**Cause 2: Wrong framework detection**
- **Solution**: Set correct framework preset in Vercel

**Cause 3: Build output in wrong directory**
- **Solution**: Check output directory settings

**Cause 4: Missing dependencies**
- **Solution**: Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`

## Quick Test
Create a minimal `pages/index.js` file with this content:
```javascript
export default function Home() {
  return <h1>Hello World - App is working!</h1>;
}
```

Then redeploy from Vercel dashboard.
